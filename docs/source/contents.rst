Network equipment CLI emulator
==============================

The Softboxen software aims at emulating the command-line admin interfaces
of various network equipment such as switches, routers, modems etc) on the
network.

These emulated devices expose their management interfaces and support
command-line dialogues in a reasonably convincing way. The main use-case
for Softboxen is to create a testing environment for network management
and automation systems.
