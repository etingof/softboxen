  title: 'CLI Simulator REST API'
  description: >
    Softboxen project aims at simulating admin interface (CLI) of various
    network devices such as network switches, routers or appliances.


    The properties of simulated devices are stored in the models. These
    models reside in SQL DB and made available via REST API endpoints.


    All kinds of simulated network devices share the same basic models.
    There core properties are collected in the `box` model. Simulated
    device might have one or more `port` objects to model I/O interfaces.
    Many other properties of a network device can be modeled such as VLAN
    interfaces, network routes etc.


    The behavioural differences in simulated devices (from CLI perspective)
    are all taken care of in the CLI frontend modules. These modules are
    built specifically to mimic particular network device model and version.
